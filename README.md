# Jerusalem City (Three.js + Vite)

A walkable 3D section of central Jerusalem (Jaffa St / Mahane Yehuda / King George,
bbox `31.778,35.210 – 31.788,35.225`) built from real OpenStreetMap data.

```bash
npm install
npm run fetch-data   # one-time: downloads OSM data to public/data/jerusalem_data.json
npm run dev
npm test             # node:test suite (synthetic data + the real data file when present)
npm run build
```

Controls: WASD move · Shift sprint · Space jump · E boost jump (reach rooftops) · drag to orbit · N day/night · R respawn.

## Data

`scripts/fetch_jerusalem.js` queries the Overpass API once for `building=*` (ways and
multipolygon relations, with courtyards), `highway=*`, parks, `natural=tree` and
neighbourhood names, and writes a compact pre-parsed JSON (flat `[lat, lon, ...]` rings).
The app then runs fully offline. If Overpass is unreachable, save a response yourself and
convert it with `node scripts/fetch_jerusalem.js --from raw.json`.

**License:** map data © OpenStreetMap contributors, ODbL 1.0. The game must show the
attribution (the HUD does). The JSON file is a derivative database: if you distribute it
(it ships inside the web build), it must stay available under the ODbL. Get legal review
before a commercial release.

## Layout

- `src/city/CityGenerator.js`
  - `generate()` (pure data): projects footprints, resolves heights (OSM `height` →
    `building:levels` → typical Jerusalem 3–6 stories), registers collision, places
    rooftop equipment, indexes roads and picks a spawn on a real street (Jaffa Road preferred).
  - `build()`: extrudes the real footprint shapes (walls, flat roofs, canopy undersides),
    merges them per 500 m chunk with `BufferGeometryUtils.mergeGeometries`, renders roads
    as ribbons along OSM lines, and draws solar water heaters (dud shemesh), AC units and
    trees as chunked `InstancedMesh`es. About 20–30 draw calls in total.
  - Jerusalem stone material: `MeshStandardMaterial` (limestone `#E3DAC9` / `#D4C5B9`,
    roughness 0.85) with a procedural ashlar pattern, arched windows, shopfronts and lit
    windows at night, all computed in world space (no textures or UVs).
- `src/city/geo.js`: lat/lon → local meters (+X east, −Z north, origin at the bbox center).
- `src/city/footprint.js`: polygon helpers and `decomposeFootprint()`, which turns any
  footprint (rotated, concave, with holes) into axis-aligned boxes for collision.
  The boxes match the real walls to within `collisionStep / 2` (0.3 m).
- `src/city/CityCollision.js`: static AABB world on a uniform XZ grid: `queryAABB`,
  `queryPoint`, `groundHeight`, `resolveSphere`, `resolveCapsule`, `raycast`.
- `src/main.js`: loads the data, then sets up the renderer, lights, day/night, the test
  player capsule and the HUD (street name, neighbourhood, touched building).

## Using the collision data

```js
const osm = await (await fetch('data/jerusalem_data.json')).json();
const city = new CityGenerator({ osm }).create();
scene.add(city.group);

// every frame, for a character whose position is its feet:
city.collision.resolveCapsule(pos, 0.4, 1.8, 0.45);  // push out of walls
pos.y = Math.max(pos.y, city.collision.groundHeight(pos.x, pos.z, pos.y + 0.45));
```
